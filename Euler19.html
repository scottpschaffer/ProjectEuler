    <h1>Counting Sundays</h1>
    <h2>You are given the following information, but you may prefer to do some research for yourself.</h2>

    <h3>1 Jan 1900 was a Monday.</h3>
    <h3>Thirty days has September,</h3>
    <h3>April, June and November.</h3>
    <h3>All the rest have thirty-one,</h3>
    <h3>Saving February alone,</h3>
    <h3>Which has twenty-eight, rain or shine.</h3>
    <h3>And on leap years, twenty-nine.</h3>

    <h2>A leap year occurs on any year evenly divisible by 4, but not on a century unless it is divisible by 400.</h2>
    <h2>How many Sundays fell on the first of the month during the twentieth century (1 Jan 1901 to 31 Dec 2000)?</h2>

    <h3>The Answer is...</h3>
